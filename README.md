# Hi, I'm Hudson 

### 🚀 Business Development & AI Automation
I bridge the gap between sales operations and software engineering, building AI tools that solve real business problems.

- 🔭 **Currently working on: [LifeOS - Personal AI Chief of Staff](https://github.com/contact900/LifeOS)
    - *Architecture:* Orchestrating a primary router agent that delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents (Finance, Work, Business) using **LangGraph.js**.
    - *Tech Stack:* Built with **Next.js** and **Supabase** for robust RAG-based long-term memory.
- 🛠️ **I build tools like:** [MoLo CallLab](https://molocalllabs.vercel.app/) (AI sales analysis) and 'RevRider AI'(Outbound Cold Calling Agents)
- 🌱 **Learning:** Advanced agentic workflows and RAG optimization.
