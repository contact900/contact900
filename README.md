# Hi, I'm Hudson Shreve 👋

### 🚀 Business Development & AI Automation
I bridge the gap between sales operations and software engineering, building AI tools that solve real business problems.

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** A **Multi-Agent "Chief of Staff" System** (LifeOS).
    - *Architecture:* Orchestrating a primary router agent that delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents (Finance, Work, Business) using **LangGraph.js**.
    - *Tech Stack:* Built with **Next.js** and **Supabase** for robust RAG-based long-term memory.
- 🛠️ **I build tools like:** 'MoLo CallLab' (AI sales analysis) and 'RevRider AI'.
- 🌱 **Learning:** Advanced agentic workflows and RAG optimization.
